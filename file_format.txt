# File Formats

## Steps Format (dkong_*.steps)

The steps file records the sequence of key inputs and frames during a game run. The format is as follows:

1. **Difficulty Level**: An integer representing the difficulty level of the game.
2. **Seed**: The seed used for the random number generator, typically the time of the run.
3. **Steps**: A series of pairs representing the frame number and the key input. Only valid steps are recorded.
   - `<frame_num (unsigned long), key_input (char)>`
4. **End of Run**: The last frame and a terminator character to indicate the end of the run.
   - `<last_frame, TEMINATOR>` (where TERMINATOR = '~')
