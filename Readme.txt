Bonus features:  
+ The menu mechanism enables returning to the main menu from any point in the program, as well as presenting the key preset.  
+ When a Barrel explodes, the program animates the explosion on screen (Amir agreed to add a short sleep so the user can see it).  

Other:  
+ Due to the three-person submission, we added difficulty levels to the game as a mandatory extra feature.
